### Query Model of Computation
#### What Computation really is ?
An abstraction of computation process will consists of the 
- Inputs : information to string of bits
- Computation models : Turing machine, Boolean Circuits, digital circuits etc.
- Outputs : string of bits to information

#### What is the Quantum Query Model of Computation ?
In our query model of computation
- Inputs : as function, we called it input query problem i.e $f:\Sigma \to \Sigma$ where $n \; and \; m $ are the positive integers and $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$. computation makes a query meand it evaluate the function f once i.e $x \in \Sigma^n$ selected and string $f(x) \in \Sigma^m$ is made available to computation. 
- Computation : 
- Outputs : 

Note : to measure the efficiency of query algorithms by just counting the number of queries to the input they require.
